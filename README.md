# TheLostWorldARK

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This is one of the first versions of my game made using Unreal engine. This project contains an inventory system as well as a Drag and Drop system. I am making the project available because I decided to redo it using other techniques. If you are interested in this project, feel free to use it, however the name of the project should not be copied, I ask that you change the name based on your own game.
